|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| QA-1 | Performance | The system must quickly generate a full weekly study plan even under heavy load. | 3,000 simultaneous student requests for plan generation. | Student users. | High server load during midterm season. | AIDAP cloud service and recommendation engine. | Study plan generated without lag or timeout. | Average response time ≤ 2 seconds; success rate ≥ 99 %. | UC-1 |
| QA-2 | Accuracy | Engagement detection must correctly reflect real student activity. | Weekly analytics aggregation. | Lecturer dashboards. | Normal teaching period. | Data pipeline connecting LMS and analytics engine. | System flags low-participation courses with correct metrics. | ≥ 95 % accuracy in engagement classification. | UC-2 |
| QA-3 | Usability | First-time users can complete key tasks with no prior training. | New student signs in to create a study plan. | Student mobile/web interface. | Clean, guided UI. | Front-end conversational interface. | Student completes the request successfully on first attempt. | 90 % task-completion rate; satisfaction ≥ 4 / 5. | UC-1 |
| QA-4 | Reliability | The system must continue sending engagement alerts even if one data source fails. | Temporary loss of connection to LMS. | System maintainer. | Network disruption. | Data-sync module. | Fallback data and queued tasks prevent data loss. | Zero lost notifications; recovery < 1 minute. | UC-2 |
