# Iteration 1
## Step 1
| Category      | Details |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Design Purpose | 	To establish the foundational structure for a cloud-native, AI-powered conversational platform |
| Primary Functional Requirements | UC-3 (Check Next Exam Date): Represents the core student query function. UC-6 (Onboard a New Data Source): Critical for long-term system evolvability |
| Quality Attrbiutes | QA-4 (Security), QA-5 (Modifiability) |

## Step 2
This is the first iteration in the design of a greenfield system. The goal is to establish the overall, high-level structure of the system, creating a foundation that addresses the core functional need of a conversational AI agent while being fundamentally scalable, secure, and integrable.

The selected drivers for this iteration are:
- UC-3 (Check Next Exam Date): This use case defines the primary system purpose: answering user questions by pulling data from integrated sources
- QA-5 (Modifiability): This quality is crucial for the system's longevity, ensuring it can adapt to new and changing university data sources (as seen in UC-6)
- CON-1 (Use Institution's SSO): This is a critical constraint that fundamentally shapes the security and user authentication model, requiring a dedicated authentication component
- CON-2 (Use Standard APIs): This constraint directly shapes the integration strategy and the interfaces between the system's components and external data sources, supporting QA-5

## Step 3
We want to refine the entire AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) system to define its initial, high-level architectural structure.
